# Design TODO
- [] Decide if this should be built on the EVM, using plutus or marlowe, or be a new chain
  - [] Investigate EVM and Solidity
  - [] Investigate Plutus and Marlowe

- [] Design complete transaction contract and all the phases (step 3)

- [] Determine how to verify a complete transaction (step 4)

- [] Finish Design Sheet
- [] Research dentralized exchanges, as this is more like that than a transaction ledger

- [] Read through p2p ride-matching document and figure out which algorithms are best
